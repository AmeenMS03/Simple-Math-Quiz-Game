# Simple Math Quiz Game

This project is a simple math quiz game, designed as part of the SWE201 course at Abu Dhabi University. The game features two levels: multiplication questions in Level 1 and multi-operation questions in Level 2. Players must answer 10 questions correctly to advance to the next level, and the game ends once 20 questions are answered in Level 2.

## Features:
- **Level 1**: Multiplication questions with randomly generated 1-digit numbers.
- **Level 2**: Combination of operations using 2-digit numbers. Players must input only the number before the decimal point.
- Points are awarded for correct answers, and the game proceeds to the next question if an incorrect answer is given.
- The game ends once the player scores 20 points in Level 2.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
- Random class for question generation
- Boolean logic for answer validation
